# =============================================================================
# KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VERSIONS:
#
# Version 1 (Your Implementation):
# - Uses RGB color generation (0-255 values)
# - Explicit shape names in tuples for clarity
# - More structured with detailed comments
# - Separate random_color() function
# - Educational approach with shape names
#
# Version 2 (Course Implementation):
# - Uses predefined named colors (turtle built-ins)
# - Compact range loop (3 to 11)
# - More concise and direct
# - Global turtle usage in function
# - Simpler but effective approach
#
# Both create the same 8 shapes (triangle through decagon) with random colors!
# The key learning: There are multiple ways to solve the same problem!
