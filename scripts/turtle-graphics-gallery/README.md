> 🎨 Creative coding scripts that generate beautiful algorithmic art using Python's turtle graphics module.

*Part of the [DevVault](https://github.com/qusai-Kagal/DevVault) collection - a personal coding vault for learning, creating, and growing.*

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to this directory in DevVault
cd DevVault/scripts/turtle-graphics-gallery

# Run any script individually
python polygon_overlay.py     # 🔺 Geometric shapes
python random_walk.py         # 🚶 Random movement art  
python spirograph.py          # ⭕ Mathematical patterns

# Run the main collection (all projects)
python main.py               # 🎨 Complete gallery experience
```

## 🎨 Featured Scripts

### 🔺 `polygon_overlay.py` - Geometric Art Generator
Creates overlapping polygons from triangles to decagons with vibrant colors.

- Uses both RGB random colors and named color palettes
- Demonstrates two implementation approaches

**💡 Key Concepts:**
- Loop structures and geometric calculations
- Color randomization techniques
- Function-based modular design

---

### 🚶 `random_walk.py` - Algorithmic Movement Art
Generates organic, maze-like patterns through random directional movement.

**🔧 What it does:**
- Takes 200 random steps with thick colorful lines
- Moves in cardinal directions (North, South, East, West)
- Creates unique patterns every run

**💡 Key Concepts:**
- Random number generation and probability
- Algorithmic art and generative design
- Mathematical movement patterns

---

### ⭕ `spirograph.py` - Mathematical Pattern Generator
Creates intricate geometric designs using rotating circles and mathematical precision.

**🔧 What it does:**
- Draws 360 overlapping circles in a rotating pattern
