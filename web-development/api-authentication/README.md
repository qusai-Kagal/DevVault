# 🔐 API Authentication with Node.js

A beginner-friendly backend authentication setup using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. This project demonstrates how to secure API routes with token-based authentication.

## 🚀 Features

- User signup and login  
- Password hashing using `bcrypt`  
- Token generation using `jsonwebtoken`  
- Middleware for protected routes  
- Minimal and easy to extend  

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- JSON Web Tokens (`jsonwebtoken`)  
- Bcrypt for password hashing  
- Postman for API testing  

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
api-authentication/
├── node_modules/
├── index.js          # Main server logic
├── package.json
└── .env              # (For storing JWT secret)
```

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- RESTful API principles  
- Middleware and routing in Express  
- Secure password handling with `bcrypt`  
- Token-based authentication with `JWT`  
- Environment variables with `dotenv`  

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/qusai-Kagal/DevVault.git`

2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   `cd DevVault/web-development/api-authentication`

3. Install dependencies:  
   `npm install`

4. Create a `.env` file and add:  
   `JWT_SECRET=yourSecretKey`

5. Start the server:  
   `node index.js`

## 📬 API Endpoints

| Method | Route         | Description       | Access     |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| POST   | `/signup`     | Register a user   | Public     |
| POST   | `/login`      | Log in a user     | Public     |
| GET    | `/protected`  | Protected route   | Requires JWT |

> Use Postman to test the endpoints by sending token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.

## ✅ To-Do / Ideas

- Integrate MongoDB with Mongoose  
- Add logout and token expiry  
- Refresh tokens implementation  
- Role-based access control
