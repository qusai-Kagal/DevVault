> **Part of [DevVault](https://github.com/qusai-Kagal/DevVault)** - Interactive turtle graphics games from Day 19 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Challenge

## 🎮 Games Overview

This project contains two interactive turtle graphics games that demonstrate fundamental game development concepts using Python's built-in turtle module.

### 1. 🎨 Etch-A-Sketch Game
**File:** `main.py`

Transform your keyboard into a digital drawing tool! Control a turtle to create beautiful artwork with smooth, responsive controls.

**🎯 Features:**
- Real-time keyboard input handling
- Smooth turtle movement in all directions
- Instant screen clearing functionality
- Intuitive WASD control scheme

**🎮 Controls:**
- **W** → Move Forward 🔼
- **S** → Move Backward 🔽
- **A** → Turn Left ◀️
- **D** → Turn Right ▶️
- **C** → Clear Screen 🧹
- **Click** → Exit 🖱️

### 2. 🏁 Turtle Race Game
**File:** `turtle_race.py`

Experience the thrill of competitive turtle racing! Place your bet and watch six colorful turtles race to victory in this exciting gambling-style game.

**🎯 Features:**
- Interactive betting system with 6 turtle colors
- Real-time race simulation with random movement
- Win/loss detection and feedback
- Colorful, engaging visual presentation

**🌈 Available Turtles:**
`Red` | `Orange` | `Yellow` | `Green` | `Blue` | `Purple`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (turtle module included by default)
- No additional dependencies required!

### Running the Games

1. **Clone DevVault Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qusai-Kagal/DevVault.git
   cd DevVault/game-development/turtle-interactive-games
   ```

2. **Launch Etch-A-Sketch**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Start Turtle Race**
   ```bash
   python turtle_race.py
   ```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Concepts Demonstrated
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Keyboard input handling using `screen.onkey()`
- **Game Loop Logic**: Continuous race simulation with win condition checking
- **Object Management**: Multiple turtle instances with individual properties
- **User Interface**: Interactive prompts and visual feedback systems
- **Randomization**: Unpredictable game outcomes using `random.randint()`

✅ **Code Organization** - Clean, commented, and maintainable code structure  

## 🎯 Development Journey

**Course Context:** Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code - Day 19  
**Focus Topic:** Instances, State, and Higher Order Functions  
**Skill Level:** Intermediate Beginner  
**Time Investment:** ~2 hours  

This project marks a significant milestone in my Python journey, transitioning from basic scripting to interactive application development. The games showcase event-driven programming concepts that form the foundation for more complex game development projects.
