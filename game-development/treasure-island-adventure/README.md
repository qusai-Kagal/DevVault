# 🏴‍☠️ Treasure Island Adventure

> **Part of [DevVault](../../README.md) → Game Development Collection**

A text-based treasure hunting adventure game built with Python as part of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course.

## 🎮 About This Game

Navigate through dangerous choices to find the hidden treasure! This interactive command-line adventure features ASCII art and multiple branching storylines where one wrong move means game over.

## 🎯 How to Play

**Your Mission**: Find the treasure by making the right choices at each crossroad.

**The Journey**:
1. 🛤️ **Crossroad**: Go `left` or `right`?
2. 🏊‍♂️ **Lake**: `Wait` for a boat or `swim` across?
3. 🚪 **Three Doors**: Choose `red`, `yellow`, or `blue`?

⚠️ **Warning**: Only ONE path leads to victory. Choose wisely!

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to this directory
cd game-development/treasure-island-adventure

# Run the game
python main.py
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Terminal/Command prompt

## 🎲 Possible Outcomes

| Choice Path | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| ✅ Left → Wait → Yellow | 🏆 **YOU WIN!** |
| ❌ Right | 💀 Fall into a hole |
| ❌ Left → Swim | 🐟 Attacked by trout |
| ❌ Left → Wait → Red | 🔥 Burned by fire |
| ❌ Left → Wait → Blue | 🐻 Eaten by beasts |

## 🧠 Key Programming Concepts

This project demonstrates:
- **Conditional Logic**: `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- **User Input**: `input()` function with validation
- **String Methods**: `.lower()` for case handling
- **Multi-line Strings**: Raw strings with `r'''`
- **ASCII Art**: Visual enhancement in console applications
- **Game Flow**: Branching narrative structure
